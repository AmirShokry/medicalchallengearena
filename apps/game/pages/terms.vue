			between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding

			arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs

			<strong>16.4. Arbitration Procedures.</strong> Arbitration will be
			conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American
			Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including
			the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA
			Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information
			on the AAA, please visit its website,
			<a
				target="_blank"
				class="underline underline-offset-2 transition-opacity duration-300 hover:opacity-75 motion-reduce:transition-none md:-tracking-2"

			<a

				class="underline underline-offset-2 transition-opacity duration-300 hover:opacity-75 motion-reduce:transition-none md:-tracking-2"
				href="https://www.adr.org/consumer"
				>https://www.adr.org/consumer</a
			>. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules
			and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of
			this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator
			determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
			Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
			arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these
			Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
			including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and
			arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration
			proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and
			other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same
			damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to
			an individual under these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the
			arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court
			only for very limited reasons. Unless MCA and you agree otherwise,
			any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient
			location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to
			travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable
			to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If
			your claim is for $10,000 or less, MCA agrees that you may choose
			whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of
			documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing,
			or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your
			claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by
			the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is
			conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision
			sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
			which the award is based.

			<strong>16.5. Costs of Arbitration.</strong> Payment of all filing,
			administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “<strong
				>Arbitration Fees</strong
			>”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in
			this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent any Arbitration Fees are
			not specifically allocated to either MCA or you under the AAA Rules,
			MCA and you shall split them equally; provided that if you are able
			to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to
			pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator
			otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required
			to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees, MCA will pay your
			portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the
			arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
			compared to the costs of litigation, MCA will pay as much of the
			Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
			arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’
			fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
